*CONTROLS*
Rotate the ball using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.
This game uses a three-click system. Press the spacebar once to start the red bar.

The second click fixes the red bar in place. The fullness represents the power of your shot.

The third and final click is for accuracy. There is a white line on the left side of the bar,
click spacebar when this line overlaps with the moving left line. See the trailer for more details.
